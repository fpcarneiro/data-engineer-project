    "__Supporting officials' decision-making to provide better visitors experience in the US__\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this data engineering capstone project is to give students a chance to combine what they've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of learners portfolio that will help to achieve data engineering-related career goals. We could choose to complete the project provided by the Udacity team or define the scope and data ourselves. I took the first approach in building the DW on the data on immigration to the United States provided by Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Scenario\n",
    "We are D2I (Data to Insights), a business consulting firm specialized in data warehouse services through assisting the enterprises with navigating their data needs and creating strategic operational solutions that deliver tangible business results. Specifically, we can help with the modernization of corporations' data warehousing infrastructure by improving performance and ease of use for end users, enhancing functionality, decreasing total cost of ownership while making it possible for real-time decision making. In total, our full suite of services includes helping enterprises with data profiling, data standardization, data acquisition, data transformation and integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been contracted by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help them see what is hidden behind the data flood. We aim to model and create a brand new analytics solution on top of the state-of-the-art technolgies available to enable them to unleash insights from data then providing better customer experiences when coming to the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Project\n",
    "Following the Udacity guide for this project, we structured this documentation with steps below:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"

    "\n",
    "_Explain what you plan to do in the project in more detail. What data do you use? What is your end solution look like? What tools did you use? etc_\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scope \n",
    "The main deliverable of our work here will be a data warehouse in the cloud that will support answering questions through analytics tables and dashboards. Additionally, as we developed a general source-of-truth database, the Government of the US could open the solution through a web API so backend web services could query the warehouse for information relating to international visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "For this work we have used the immigration, the global temperature and demographics datasets as well as the descriptions contained in the `I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Architecture\n",
    "The whole solution is cloud based on top of __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__. First, all the datasets were preprocessed with __Apache Spark__ and stored in a staging area in __AWS S3__ bucket. Then, we loaded those to a __Amazon Redshift__ cluster using an __Apache Airflow__ pipeline that transfer and check the quality of the data to finally provide our customers a data mart for their convenient analysis. Aditionally, we developed an sample dashbord using __Microsoft Power BI__.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](images/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main information and questions a user may want to extract from the data mart would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visitors by nationality.\n",
    "* Visitors by origin.\n",
    "* Visitors by airline.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and the source country.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and source climates.\n",
    "* Correlations between immigration by source region, and the source region temperature.\n",
    "* Correlations between visitor demographics, and states visited.\n",

    "__Immigration Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main dataset and there is a file for each month of the year of 2016 available in the directory `../../data/18-83510-I94-Data-2016/` in the [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) binary database storage format `sas7bdat`. Combined, the 12 datasets have got more than 40 million rows (40.790.529) and 28 columns. For most of the work we used only the month of April of 2016 which has more than three million records (3.096.313)."

    "The Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has repackaged the data from a newer compilation put it all together. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.\n",

We gave this data most of the focus during our modeling phase. The immigration dataset is also the data source for the DATE dimmension table. We extracted all the distinct values of the columns arrdate and depdate and applied various functions to store in the table a number of attributes of a particular date: day, month, year, week of year and day of week.\n",

Median Age, Male Population, Female Population, Total Population, Number of Veterans, Foreign-born were first aggregated by `City` using `first` function, since they are repeated accross the different rows of the same city. Then, we grouped the resulting rows by `State` applying the `sum` function in the numeric columns to make a cosolidated total in each U.S State. We needed to transform the column `Race` in order to make its different values to become different columns. We achieve this by usig the pivot function of the `pyspark` package. As a result we reached to a final structure where we have got the columns (BlackOrAfricanAmerican, White, ForeignBorn, AmericanIndianAndAlaskaNative, HispanicOrLatino, Asian, NumberVeterans, FemalePopulation, MalePopulation, TotalPopulation) for each of the states of the U.S.\n",
